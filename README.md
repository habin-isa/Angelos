# Angelos
This is our final 2 week project at Makers Academy. We have built app that allows a user to enter an emergency contact, then press a discrete button to alert their given contact in an emergency.

## Technologies Used
* Swift
* XCode
* CocoaPods - Nimble, Quick, Alamofire
* Twilio API

## Using the App
* Clone the repo
* Pod install
* Plug in an Apple device
* Build and run with your device as the selected target
* Press Command + U to run tests in Xcode

## Week One

### Day 1

After the groups were announced, our team gathered together and brain stormed ideas. By midday, we decided to build a mobile distress app using Swift and Xcode.

We spent the rest of the day exploring Swift and Xcode in pairs by creating a simple hello world app, and by TDDing FizzBuzz.

### Day 2

In the morning, the team agreed that the main objective of first two day sprint would be to get to our MVP - a user could open an app, enter a number (which would persist if they closed and reopened the app), and then press a button to send an automatic text. We decided to play around with the technologies in practice apps.

* Muzzi and Charly got a text to send using the Twilio API
* Habin, Jess and Dione figured out how to persist a phone number in the app

### Day 3

At our morning stand up we discussed our progress from the previous day, talked through the code we had written and agreed on the next steps required to meet our MVP. We also spent some time modelling our domain. We also decided to swap the pairs to ensure that each person in the group had a good understanding of each part of our application.

* Dione and Muzzi worked on Twilio
* Charly, Jess and Habin began TDDing the domain

### Day 4

We began day 4 by talking through the previous day's work, and dividing the responsibilities for that day. We decided that one group would finish TDDing the basic functionality required to meet our MVP, while the next pair would move on to building a new feature.

* Muzzi, Charly and Dione TDDd the model, view and controller to meet the MVP
* Jess and Habin worked out how to implement a location sharing feature

### Day 5

Now that we had our MVP (a user could open the app, enter their name and an emergency contact number that would persist, and discretely send a text) Friday morning's stand up was spent planning other features that we wanted to implement. We decided to focus on tasks that we felt we could complete before the weekend, then define another two day sprint on Monday morning which would take us to Tuesday's feature freeze,

* Jess and Muzzi continued working on the location feature
* Dione and Charly added functionality to send multiple message types 
* Habin began working on the disguise feature
