## Week One

### Day 1

After the groups were announced, we gathered together and brain stormed ideas. By midday, we decided to build a mobile distress app using Swift and Xcode.

We spent the rest of the day exploring Swift and Xcode in pairs by creating a simple hello world app, and by TDDing FizzBuzz.

### Day 2

In the morning, we agreed that the main objective of first two day sprint would be to get to our MVP - a user could open an app, enter a number (which would persist if they closed and reopened the app), and then press a button to send an automatic text. We decided to play around with the technologies in practice apps.

* Muzzi and Charly got a text to send using the Twilio API
* Habin, Jess and Dione figured out how to persist a phone number in the app

### Day 3
