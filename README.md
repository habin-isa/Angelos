## Week One

### Day 1

After the groups were announced, our team gathered together and brain stormed ideas. By midday, we decided to build a mobile distress app using Swift and Xcode.

We spent the rest of the day exploring Swift and Xcode in pairs by creating a simple hello world app, and by TDDing FizzBuzz.

### Day 2

In the morning, the team agreed that the main objective of first two day sprint would be to get to our MVP - a user could open an app, enter a number (which would persist if they closed and reopened the app), and then press a button to send an automatic text. We decided to play around with the technologies in practice apps.

* Muzzi and Charly got a text to send using the Twilio API
* Habin, Jess and Dione figured out how to persist a phone number in the app

### Day 3

At our morning stand up we discussed our progress from the previous day, talked through the code we had written and agreed on the next steps required to meet our MVP. We also spent some time modelling our domain. We also decided to swap the pairs to ensure that each person in the group had a good understanding of each part of our application.

* Dione and Muzzi worked on Twilio
* Charly, Jess and Habin began TDDing the domain
